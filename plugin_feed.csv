      The remote Oracle Linux 9 host has packages installed that are affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the ELSA-2022-9596 advisory.  - shim: Buffer overflow when loading crafted EFI images (CVE-2022-28737)  - A heap out-of-bounds write may heppen during the handling of Huffman tables in the PNG reader. This may     lead to data corruption in the heap space. Confidentiality, Integrity and Availablity impact may be     considered Low as it's very complex to an attacker control the encoding and positioning of corrupted     Huffman entries to achieve results such as arbitrary code execution and/or secure boot circumvention. This     flaw affects grub2 versions prior grub-2.12. (CVE-2021-3696)  - grub2: Out-of-bound write when handling split HTTP headers (CVE-2022-28734)  - A crafted 16-bit grayscale PNG image may lead to a out-of-bounds write in the heap area. An attacker may     take advantage of that to cause heap data corruption or eventually arbitrary code execution and circumvent     secure boot protections. This issue has a high complexity to be exploited as an attacker needs to perform     some triage over the heap layout to achieve signifcant results, also the values written into the memory     are repeated three times in a row making difficult to produce valid payloads. This flaw affects grub2     versions prior grub-2.12.

(CVE-2021-26341)  - An out of memory bounds write flaw (1 or 2 bytes of memory) in the Linux kernel NFS subsystem was found in     the way users use mirroring (replication of files with NFS). A user, having access to the NFS mount, could     potentially use this flaw to crash the system or escalate privileges on the system. (CVE-2021-4157)  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Atheros wireless adapter driver in the way a user     forces the ath9k_htc_wait_for_target function to fail with some input messages. This flaw allows a local     user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2022-1679)  - In lg_probe and related functions of hid-lg.c and other USB HID files, there is a possible out of bounds     read due to improper input validation.

      Description
      The version of FreeBSD installed on the remote host is prior to tested version. It is, therefore, affected by a vulnerability as referenced in the b99f99f6-021e-11ed-8c6f-000c29ffbb6c advisory.  - Git is a distributed revision control system. Git prior to versions 2.37.1, 2.36.2, 2.35.4, 2.34.4,     2.33.4, 2.32.3, 2.31.4, and 2.30.5, is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all platforms. An     unsuspecting user could still be affected by the issue reported in CVE-2022-24765, for example when     navigating as root into a shared tmp directory that is owned by them, but where an attacker could create a     git repository. Versions 2.37.1, 2.36.2, 2.35.4, 2.34.4, 2.33.4, 2.32.3, 2.31.4, and 2.30.5 contain a     patch for this issue. The simplest way to avoid being affected by the exploit described in the example is     to avoid running git as root (or an Administrator in Windows), and if needed to reduce its use to a     minimum. While a generic workaround is not possible, a system could be hardened from the exploit described     in the example by removing any such repository if it exists already and creating one as root to block any     future attacks.

This     may allow an attacker to zip bomb the decompressor by sending a small highly compressed payload.    Maliciously constructed zip files may exhaust system memory and cause a denial of service. Users are     advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may consider disabling decompression. (CVE-2022-29225)  - Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance proxy. Versions of envoy prior to 1.22.1 are subject to a     segmentation fault in the GrpcHealthCheckerImpl. Envoy can perform various types of upstream health     checking. One of them uses gRPC. Envoy also has a feature which can hold? (prevent removal) upstream     hosts obtained via service discovery until configured active health checking fails. If an attacker     controls an upstream host and also controls service discovery of that host (via DNS, the EDS API, etc.),     an attacker can crash Envoy by forcing removal of the host from service discovery, and then failing the     gRPC health check request. This will crash Envoy via a null pointer dereference. Users are advised to     upgrade to resolve this vulnerability. Users unable to upgrade may disable gRPC health checking and/or     replace it with a different health checking type as a mitigation. (CVE-2022-29224)  - Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance proxy. In versions prior to 1.22.1 the OAuth filter would try to     invoke the remaining filters in the chain after emitting a local response, which triggers an ASSERT() in     newer versions and corrupts memory on earlier versions. continueDecoding() shouldnt ever be called from     filters after a local reply has been sent. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds     for this issue. (CVE-2022-29228)  - Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. In versions prior to 1.22.1 if Envoy     attempts to send an internal redirect of an HTTP request consisting of more than HTTP headers, theres a     lifetime bug which can be triggered. If while replaying the request Envoy sends a local reply when the     redirect headers are processed, the downstream state indicates that the downstream stream is not complete.    On sending the local reply, Envoy will attempt to reset the upstream stream, but as it is actually     complete, and deleted, this result in a use-after-free. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to     upgrade are advised to disable internal redirects if crashes are observed. (CVE-2022-29227)  - Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance proxy. In versions prior to 1.22.1 the OAuth filter     implementation does not include a mechanism for validating access tokens, so by design when the HMAC     signed cookie is missing a full authentication flow should be triggered. However, the current     implementation assumes that access tokens are always validated thus allowing access in the presence of any     access token attached to the request. Users are advised to upgrade. There is no known workaround for this     issue. (CVE-2022-29226)Note that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.

      Nessus Plugin ID 163015 with High Severity
      Synopsis
      The remote SUSE host is missing a security update.
      Description
      The remote SUSE Linux SLES12 host has packages installed that are affected by a vulnerability as referenced in the SUSE- SU-2022:2333-1 advisory.  - Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap     buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other     malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But     there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read.    While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the     octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence     of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote     exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing     modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`,     `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to     directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module     `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present     on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be     specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important     modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability. (CVE-2022-24903)Note that Nessus has not tested for this issue but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.

      The remote Oracle Linux 7 host has packages installed that are affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the ELSA-2022-9587 advisory.  - Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices. In affected versions ill-formed     headers sent to Envoy in certain configurations can lead to unexpected memory access resulting in     undefined behavior or crashing. Users are most likely at risk if they have an Istio ingress Gateway     exposed to external traffic. This vulnerability has been resolved in versions 1.12.8, 1.13.5, and 1.14.1.    Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. (CVE-2022-31045)  - Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance proxy. In versions prior to 1.22.1 secompressors accumulate     decompressed data into an intermediate buffer before overwriting the body in the decode/encodeBody. This     may allow an attacker to zip bomb the decompressor by sending a small highly compressed payload.    Maliciously constructed zip files may exhaust system memory and cause a denial of service. Users are     advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may consider disabling decompression. (CVE-2022-29225)  - Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance proxy. Versions of envoy prior to 1.22.1 are subject to a     segmentation fault in the GrpcHealthCheckerImpl. Envoy can perform various types of upstream health     checking. One of them uses gRPC. Envoy also has a feature which can hold? (prevent removal) upstream     hosts obtained via service discovery until configured active health checking fails. If an attacker     controls an upstream host and also controls service discovery of that host (via DNS, the EDS API, etc.),     an attacker can crash Envoy by forcing removal of the host from service discovery, and then failing the     gRPC health check request. This will crash Envoy via a null pointer dereference. Users are advised to     upgrade to resolve this vulnerability. Users unable to upgrade may disable gRPC health checking and/or     replace it with a different health checking type as a mitigation. (CVE-2022-29224)  - Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance proxy. In versions prior to 1.22.1 the OAuth filter would try to     invoke the remaining filters in the chain after emitting a local response, which triggers an ASSERT() in     newer versions and corrupts memory on earlier versions. continueDecoding() shouldnt ever be called from     filters after a local reply has been sent. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds     for this issue. (CVE-2022-29228)  - Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. In versions prior to 1.22.1 if Envoy     attempts to send an internal redirect of an HTTP request consisting of more than HTTP headers, theres a     lifetime bug which can be triggered. If while replaying the request Envoy sends a local reply when the     redirect headers are processed, the downstream state indicates that the downstream stream is not complete.    On sending the local reply, Envoy will attempt to reset the upstream stream, but as it is actually     complete, and deleted, this result in a use-after-free. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to     upgrade are advised to disable internal redirects if crashes are observed. (CVE-2022-29227)  - Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance proxy. In versions prior to 1.22.1 the OAuth filter     implementation does not include a mechanism for validating access tokens, so by design when the HMAC     signed cookie is missing a full authentication flow should be triggered. However, the current     implementation assumes that access tokens are always validated thus allowing access in the presence of any     access token attached to the request. Users are advised to upgrade. There is no known workaround for this     issue. (CVE-2022-29226)Note that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.

      Description
      The remote SUSE Linux SLED15 / SLES15 host has packages installed that are affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the SUSE-SU-2022:2342-1 advisory.  - Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request Smuggling') vulnerability in mod_proxy_ajp of     Apache HTTP Server allows an attacker to smuggle requests to the AJP server it forwards requests to. This     issue affects Apache HTTP Server Apache HTTP Server 2.4 version 2.4.53 and prior versions.    (CVE-2022-26377)  - The ap_rwrite() function in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may read unintended memory if an     attacker can cause the server to reflect very large input using ap_rwrite() or ap_rputs(), such as with     mod_luas r:puts() function. Modules compiled and distributed separately from Apache HTTP Server that use     the 'ap_rputs' function and may pass it a very large (INT_MAX or larger) string must be compiled against     current headers to resolve the issue. (CVE-2022-28614)  - Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may crash or disclose information due to a read beyond bounds in     ap_strcmp_match() when provided with an extremely large input buffer. While no code distributed with the     server can be coerced into such a call, third-party modules or lua scripts that use ap_strcmp_match() may     hypothetically be affected. (CVE-2022-28615)  - In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier, a malicious request to a lua script that calls r:parsebody(0)     may cause a denial of service due to no default limit on possible input size. (CVE-2022-29404)  - If Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 is configured to do transformations with mod_sed in contexts where the input     to mod_sed may be very large, mod_sed may make excessively large memory allocations and trigger an abort.    (CVE-2022-30522)  - Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may return lengths to applications calling r:wsread() that point     past the end of the storage allocated for the buffer. (CVE-2022-30556)  - Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may not send the X-Forwarded-* headers to the origin server based on     client side Connection header hop-by-hop mechanism.

      Nessus Plugin ID 162999 with High Severity
      Synopsis
      The remote SUSE host is missing one or more security updates.
      Description
      The remote SUSE Linux SLES15 host has packages installed that are affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the SUSE-SU-2022:2341-1 advisory.  - runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification. A bug     was found in runc prior to version 1.1.2 where `runc exec --cap` created processes with non-empty     inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with     inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during execve(2). This     bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities     than were included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in runc 1.1.2. This fix     changes `runc exec --cap` behavior such that the additional capabilities granted to the process being     executed (as specified via `--cap` arguments) do not include inheritable capabilities. In addition, `runc     spec` is changed to not set any inheritable capabilities in the created example OCI spec (`config.json`)     file. (CVE-2022-29162)  - containerd is an open source container runtime. A bug was found in the containerd's CRI implementation     where programs inside a container can cause the containerd daemon to consume memory without bound during     invocation of the `ExecSync` API. This can cause containerd to consume all available memory on the     computer, denying service to other legitimate workloads. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to     use containerd's CRI implementation; `ExecSync` may be used when running probes or when executing     processes via an exec facility. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.6 and 1.5.13. Users should     update to these versions to resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted     images and commands are used. (CVE-2022-31030)Note that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.

      Nessus Plugin ID 162965 with Critical Severity
      Synopsis
      The remote SUSE host is missing one or more security updates.
      Description
      The remote SUSE Linux SLED15 / SLES15 host has packages installed that are affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the SUSE-SU-2022:2306-1 advisory.  - The c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection. This     script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such     operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of     the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool.    Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1o (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1n).    Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2ze (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zd). (CVE-2022-1292)  - The function `OCSP_basic_verify` verifies the signer certificate on an OCSP response. In the case where     the (non-default) flag OCSP_NOCHECKS is used then the response will be positive (meaning a successful     verification) even in the case where the response signing certificate fails to verify. It is anticipated     that most users of `OCSP_basic_verify` will not use the OCSP_NOCHECKS flag. In this case the     `OCSP_basic_verify` function will return a negative value (indicating a fatal error) in the case of a     certificate verification failure. The normal expected return value in this case would be 0. This issue     also impacts the command line OpenSSL ocsp application. When verifying an ocsp response with the    -no_cert_checks option the command line application will report that the verification is successful even     though it has in fact failed. In this case the incorrect successful response will also be accompanied by     error messages showing the failure and contradicting the apparently successful result. Fixed in OpenSSL     3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2). (CVE-2022-1343)  - The OpenSSL 3.0 implementation of the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite incorrectly uses the AAD data as the MAC key.    This makes the MAC key trivially predictable. An attacker could exploit this issue by performing a man-in-     the-middle attack to modify data being sent from one endpoint to an OpenSSL 3.0 recipient such that the     modified data would still pass the MAC integrity check. Note that data sent from an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint     to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will always be rejected by the recipient and the connection will fail at     that point. Many application protocols require data to be sent from the client to the server first.    Therefore, in such a case, only an OpenSSL 3.0 server would be impacted when talking to a non-OpenSSL 3.0     client. If both endpoints are OpenSSL 3.0 then the attacker could modify data being sent in both     directions. In this case both clients and servers could be affected, regardless of the application     protocol. Note that in the absence of an attacker this bug means that an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint     communicating with a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will fail to complete the handshake when using this     ciphersuite. The confidentiality of data is not impacted by this issue, i.e. an attacker cannot decrypt     data that has been encrypted using this ciphersuite - they can only modify it. In order for this attack to     work both endpoints must legitimately negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite. This ciphersuite is not compiled     by default in OpenSSL 3.0, and is not available within the default provider or the default ciphersuite     list. This ciphersuite will never be used if TLSv1.3 has been negotiated. In order for an OpenSSL 3.0     endpoint to use this ciphersuite the following must have occurred: 1) OpenSSL must have been compiled with     the (non-default) compile time option enable-weak-ssl-ciphers 2) OpenSSL must have had the legacy provider     explicitly loaded (either through application code or via configuration) 3) The ciphersuite must have been     explicitly added to the ciphersuite list 4) The libssl security level must have been set to 0 (default is     1) 5) A version of SSL/TLS below TLSv1.3 must have been negotiated 6) Both endpoints must negotiate the     RC4-MD5 ciphersuite in preference to any others that both endpoints have in common Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3     (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2). (CVE-2022-1434)  - The OPENSSL_LH_flush() function, which empties a hash table, contains a bug that breaks reuse of the     memory occuppied by the removed hash table entries. This function is used when decoding certificates or     keys. If a long lived process periodically decodes certificates or keys its memory usage will expand     without bounds and the process might be terminated by the operating system causing a denial of service.    Also traversing the empty hash table entries will take increasingly more time. Typically such long lived     processes might be TLS clients or TLS servers configured to accept client certificate authentication. The     function was added in the OpenSSL 3.0 version thus older releases are not affected by the issue. Fixed in     OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2). (CVE-2022-1473)  - In addition to the c_rehash shell command injection identified in CVE-2022-1292, further circumstances     where the c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection     were found by code review. When the CVE-2022-1292 was fixed it was not discovered that there are other     places in the script where the file names of certificates being hashed were possibly passed to a command     executed through the shell. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is     automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the     privileges of the script. Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the     OpenSSL rehash command line tool. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.4 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2,3.0.3). Fixed in     OpenSSL 1.1.1p (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1o). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zf (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2ze). (CVE-2022-2068)  - AES OCB mode for 32-bit x86 platforms using the AES-NI assembly optimised implementation will not encrypt     the entirety of the data under some circumstances. This could reveal sixteen bytes of data that was     preexisting in the memory that wasn't written. In the special case of in place encryption, sixteen bytes     of the plaintext would be revealed. Since OpenSSL does not support OCB based cipher suites for TLS and     DTLS, they are both unaffected. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.5 (Affected 3.0.0-3.0.4). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1q     (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1p). (CVE-2022-2097)Note that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.

      Synopsis
      The remote SUSE host is missing a security update.
      Description
      The remote SUSE Linux SLES12 host has packages installed that are affected by a vulnerability as referenced in the SUSE- SU-2022:2314-1 advisory.  - Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap     buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other     malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But     there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read.    While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the     octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence     of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote     exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing     modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`,     `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to     directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module     `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present     on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be     specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important     modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability. (CVE-2022-24903)Note that Nessus has not tested for this issue but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.

      Nessus Plugin ID 162939 with High Severity
      Synopsis
      The remote SUSE host is missing one or more security updates.
      Description
      The remote SUSE Linux SLES12 host has packages installed that are affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the SUSE-SU-2022:2289-1 advisory.  - If an object prototype was corrupted by an attacker, they would have been able to set undesired attributes     on a JavaScript object, leading to privileged code execution.  (CVE-2022-2200)  - An attacker could have injected CSS into stylesheets accessible via internal URIs, such as resource:, and     in doing so bypass a page's Content Security Policy.  (CVE-2022-31744)  - An iframe that was not permitted to run scripts could do so if the user clicked on a     javascript: link.  (CVE-2022-34468)  - Navigations between XML documents may have led to a use-after-free and potentially exploitable crash.    (CVE-2022-34470)  - If there was a PAC URL set and the server that hosts the PAC was not reachable, OCSP requests would have     been blocked, resulting in incorrect error pages being shown.  (CVE-2022-34472)  - The ms-msdt, search, and search-ms protocols deliver content to     Microsoft applications, bypassing the browser, when a user accepts a prompt. These applications have had     known vulnerabilities, exploited in the wild (although we know of none exploited through Thunderbird), so     in this release Thunderbird has blocked these protocols from prompting the user to open them. This bug     only affects Thunderbird on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.  (CVE-2022-34478)  - A malicious website that could create a popup could have resized the popup to overlay the address bar with     its own content, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks.   This bug only affects     Thunderbird for Linux. Other operating systems are unaffected.  (CVE-2022-34479)  - In the nsTArrayImpl::ReplaceElementsAt() function, an integer overflow could have occurred     when the number of elements to replace was too large for the container.  (CVE-2022-34481)  - The Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported potential vulnerabilities present in Thunderbird 91.10. Some of these     bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have     been exploited to run arbitrary code.  (CVE-2022-34484)Note that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.

      Description
      The remote SUSE Linux SLED15 / SLES15 host has packages installed that are affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the SUSE-SU-2022:2302-1 advisory.  - Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request Smuggling') vulnerability in mod_proxy_ajp of     Apache HTTP Server allows an attacker to smuggle requests to the AJP server it forwards requests to. This     issue affects Apache HTTP Server Apache HTTP Server 2.4 version 2.4.53 and prior versions.    (CVE-2022-26377)  - The ap_rwrite() function in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may read unintended memory if an     attacker can cause the server to reflect very large input using ap_rwrite() or ap_rputs(), such as with     mod_luas r:puts() function. Modules compiled and distributed separately from Apache HTTP Server that use     the 'ap_rputs' function and may pass it a very large (INT_MAX or larger) string must be compiled against     current headers to resolve the issue. (CVE-2022-28614)  - Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may crash or disclose information due to a read beyond bounds in     ap_strcmp_match() when provided with an extremely large input buffer. While no code distributed with the     server can be coerced into such a call, third-party modules or lua scripts that use ap_strcmp_match() may     hypothetically be affected. (CVE-2022-28615)  - In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier, a malicious request to a lua script that calls r:parsebody(0)     may cause a denial of service due to no default limit on possible input size. (CVE-2022-29404)  - If Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 is configured to do transformations with mod_sed in contexts where the input     to mod_sed may be very large, mod_sed may make excessively large memory allocations and trigger an abort.    (CVE-2022-30522)  - Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may return lengths to applications calling r:wsread() that point     past the end of the storage allocated for the buffer. (CVE-2022-30556)  - Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may not send the X-Forwarded-* headers to the origin server based on     client side Connection header hop-by-hop mechanism. This may be used to bypass IP based authentication on     the origin server/application.

Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap     buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other     malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But     there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read.    While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the     octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence     of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote     exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing     modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`,     `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to     directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module     `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present     on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be     specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important     modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability. (CVE-2022-24903)Note that Nessus has not tested for this issue but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.
      Solution
      Update the affected packages.

      According to the versions of the docker-engine package installed, the EulerOS installation on the remote host is affected by the following vulnerabilities :  - Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable and accelerate software containerization. A bug     was found in Moby (Docker Engine) prior to version 20.10.14 where containers were incorrectly started with     non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling     programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during     `execve(2)`. Normally, when executable programs have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise     unprivileged users and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified file capabilities up to     the bounding set. Due to this bug, containers which included executable programs with inheritable file     capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally gain these inheritable     file capabilities up to the container's bounding set. Containers which use Linux users and groups to     perform privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted. This bug did not affect the     container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in     the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.14. Running containers     should be stopped, deleted, and recreated for the inheritable capabilities to be reset. This fix changes     Moby (Docker Engine) behavior such that containers are started with a more typical Linux environment. As a     workaround, the entry point of a container can be modified to use a utility like `capsh(1)` to drop     inheritable capabilities prior to the primary process starting.

(CVE-2022-0494)  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel's DMA subsystem, in the way a user calls DMA_FROM_DEVICE.    This flaw allows a local user to read random memory from the kernel space. (CVE-2022-0854)  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in drm_lease_held in drivers/gpu/drm/drm_lease.c in the Linux     kernel due to a race problem. This flaw allows a local user privilege attacker to cause a denial of     service (DoS) or a kernel information leak. (CVE-2022-1280)  - A vulnerability was found in the pfkey_register function in net/key/af_key.c in the Linux kernel. This     flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to gain access to kernel memory, leading to a system crash or a     leak of internal kernel information. (CVE-2022-1353)  - Linux PV device frontends vulnerable to attacks by backends T[his CNA information record relates to     multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Several Linux PV     device frontends are using the grant table interfaces for removing access rights of the backends in ways     being subject to race conditions, resulting in potential data leaks, data corruption by malicious     backends, and denial of service triggered by malicious backends: blkfront, netfront, scsifront and the     gntalloc driver are testing whether a grant reference is still in use. If this is not the case, they     assume that a following removal of the granted access will always succeed, which is not true in case the     backend has mapped the granted page between those two operations. As a result the backend can keep access     to the memory page of the guest no matter how the page will be used after the frontend I/O has finished.    The xenbus driver has a similar problem, as it doesn't check the success of removing the granted access of     a shared ring buffer. blkfront: CVE-2022-23036 netfront: CVE-2022-23037 scsifront: CVE-2022-23038     gntalloc: CVE-2022-23039 xenbus: CVE-2022-23040 blkfront, netfront, scsifront, usbfront, dmabuf, xenbus,     9p, kbdfront, and pvcalls are using a functionality to delay freeing a grant reference until it is no     longer in use, but the freeing of the related data page is not synchronized with dropping the granted     access. As a result the backend can keep access to the memory page even after it has been freed and then     re-used for a different purpose. CVE-2022-23041 netfront will fail a BUG_ON() assertion if it fails to     revoke access in the rx path. This will result in a Denial of Service (DoS) situation of the guest which     can be triggered by the backend. CVE-2022-23042 (CVE-2022-23037)  - usb_8dev_start_xmit in drivers/net/can/usb/usb_8dev.c in the Linux kernel through 5.17.1 has a double     free. (CVE-2022-28388)  - ems_usb_start_xmit in drivers/net/can/usb/ems_usb.c in the Linux kernel through 5.17.1 has a double free.    (CVE-2022-28390)  - Improper Update of Reference Count vulnerability in net/sched of Linux Kernel allows local attacker to     cause privilege escalation to root. This issue affects: Linux Kernel versions prior to 5.18; version 4.14     and later versions. (CVE-2022-29581)  - The Linux kernel before 5.17.2 mishandles seccomp permissions. The PTRACE_SEIZE code path allows attackers     to bypass intended restrictions on setting the PT_SUSPEND_SECCOMP flag. (CVE-2022-30594)Note that Tenable Network Security has extracted the preceding description block directly from the EulerOS security advisory. Tenable has attempted to automatically clean and format it as much as possible without introducing additional issues.
      Solution

      According to the versions of the git packages installed, the EulerOS installation on the remote host is affected by the following vulnerabilities :  - Git for Windows is a fork of Git containing Windows-specific patches. This vulnerability affects users     working on multi-user machines, where untrusted parties have write access to the same hard disk. Those     untrusted parties could create the folder `C:\.git`, which would be picked up by Git operations run     supposedly outside a repository while searching for a Git directory. Git would then respect any config in     said Git directory. Git Bash users who set `GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE` are vulnerable as well. Users who     installed posh-gitare vulnerable simply by starting a PowerShell. Users of IDEs such as Visual Studio are     vulnerable: simply creating a new project would already read and respect the config specified in     `C:\.git\config`. Users of the Microsoft fork of Git are vulnerable simply by starting a Git Bash. The     problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.35.2. Users unable to upgrade may create the folder `.git`     on all drives where Git commands are run, and remove read/write access from those folders as a workaround.    Alternatively, define or extend `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` to cover the _parent_ directory of the user     profile, e.g. `C:\Users` if the user profile is located in `C:\Users\my-user-name`.

      Synopsis
      The remote EulerOS host is missing a security update.
      Description
      According to the versions of the openssl packages installed, the EulerOS installation on the remote host is affected by the following vulnerabilities :  - The c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection. This     script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such     operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of     the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool.    Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1o (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1n).    Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2ze (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zd). (CVE-2022-1292)Note that Tenable Network Security has extracted the preceding description block directly from the EulerOS security advisory.

      According to the versions of the git packages installed, the EulerOS installation on the remote host is affected by the following vulnerabilities :  - Git for Windows is a fork of Git containing Windows-specific patches. This vulnerability affects users     working on multi-user machines, where untrusted parties have write access to the same hard disk. Those     untrusted parties could create the folder `C:\.git`, which would be picked up by Git operations run     supposedly outside a repository while searching for a Git directory. Git would then respect any config in     said Git directory. Git Bash users who set `GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE` are vulnerable as well. Users who     installed posh-gitare vulnerable simply by starting a PowerShell. Users of IDEs such as Visual Studio are     vulnerable: simply creating a new project would already read and respect the config specified in     `C:\.git\config`. Users of the Microsoft fork of Git are vulnerable simply by starting a Git Bash. The     problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.35.2. Users unable to upgrade may create the folder `.git`     on all drives where Git commands are run, and remove read/write access from those folders as a workaround.    Alternatively, define or extend `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` to cover the _parent_ directory of the user     profile, e.g. `C:\Users` if the user profile is located in `C:\Users\my-user-name`.

      Nessus Plugin ID 162872 with High Severity
      Synopsis
      The remote EulerOS host is missing a security update.
      Description
      According to the versions of the rsyslog package installed, the EulerOS installation on the remote host is affected by the following vulnerabilities :  - Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap     buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other     malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But     there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read.    While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the     octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence     of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote     exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing     modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`,     `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to     directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module     `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present     on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be     specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important     modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.

Tenable has attempted to automatically clean and format it as much as possible without introducing additional issues.

An attacker may     take advantage of that to cause heap data corruption or eventually arbitrary code execution and circumvent     secure boot protections. This issue has a high complexity to be exploited as an attacker needs to perform     some triage over the heap layout to achieve signifcant results, also the values written into the memory     are repeated three times in a row making difficult to produce valid payloads.

      Synopsis
      The remote Rocky Linux host is missing a security update.
      Description
      The remote Rocky Linux 8 host has packages installed that are affected by a vulnerability as referenced in the RLSA-2022:4799 advisory.  - Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap     buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other     malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But     there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read.    While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the     octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence     of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote     exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing     modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`,     `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to     directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module     `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present     on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be     specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important     modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability. (CVE-2022-24903)Note that Nessus has not tested for this issue but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.

Notes: All CVE users should reference CVE-2022-32250 instead of this     candidate. All references and descriptions in this candidate have been removed to prevent accidental     usage. (CVE-2022-1966)  - net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c in the Linux kernel through 5.18.1 allows a local user (able to create     user/net namespaces) to escalate privileges to root because an incorrect NFT_STATEFUL_EXPR check leads to     a use-after-free. (CVE-2022-32250)  - The Linux kernel before 5.17.9 allows TCP servers to identify clients by observing what source ports are     used. (CVE-2022-32296)  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.18.3 on powerpc 32-bit platforms.

      The remote Ubuntu 16.04 ESM host has a package installed that is affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the USN-5505-1 advisory.  - .A flaw was found in the CAN BCM networking protocol in the Linux kernel, where a local attacker can abuse     a flaw in the CAN subsystem to corrupt memory, crash the system or escalate privileges. This race     condition in net/can/bcm.c in the Linux kernel allows for local privilege escalation to root.    (CVE-2021-3609)  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to     the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the     system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,     integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can lead to a threat     to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. (CVE-2021-3760)  - An unprivileged write to the file handler flaw in the Linux kernel's control groups and namespaces     subsystem was found in the way users have access to some less privileged process that are controlled by     cgroups and have higher privileged parent process. It is actually both for cgroup2 and cgroup1 versions of     control groups. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the     system. (CVE-2021-4197)  - A use-after-free flaw was found in nci_request in net/nfc/nci/core.c in NFC Controller Interface (NCI) in     the Linux kernel. This flaw could allow a local attacker with user privileges to cause a data race problem     while the device is getting removed, leading to a privilege escalation problem.

      Description
      The remote Oracle Linux 7 host has packages installed that are affected by a vulnerability as referenced in the ELSA-2021-15790 advisory.  - containerd is a container runtime. A bug was found in containerd versions prior to 1.4.8 and 1.5.4 where     pulling and extracting a specially-crafted container image can result in Unix file permission changes for     existing files in the host's filesystem. Changes to file permissions can deny access to the expected owner     of the file, widen access to others, or set extended bits like setuid, setgid, and sticky. This bug does     not directly allow files to be read, modified, or executed without an additional cooperating process. This     bug has been fixed in containerd 1.5.4 and 1.4.8. As a workaround, ensure that users only pull images from     trusted sources. Linux security modules (LSMs) like SELinux and AppArmor can limit the files potentially     affected by this bug through policies and profiles that prevent containerd from interacting with specific     files.

      Nessus Plugin ID 162814 with High Severity
      Synopsis
      The remote Oracle Linux host is missing a security update.
      Description
      The remote Oracle Linux 9 host has a package installed that is affected by a vulnerability as referenced in the ELSA-2022-4899 advisory.  - The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop     forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain     elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point     encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has     invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the     certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a     denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they     can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients     consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking     certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from     subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that     use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS     issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate     which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the     public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-     signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue     affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the     15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected     1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc). (CVE-2022-0778)Note that Nessus has not tested for this issue but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.
      Solution
      Update the affected compat-openssl11 package.

      Nessus Plugin ID 162799 with High Severity
      Synopsis
      The remote Oracle Linux host is missing a security update.
      Description
      The remote Oracle Linux 9 host has packages installed that are affected by a vulnerability as referenced in the ELSA-2022-4795 advisory.  - Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap     buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other     malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But     there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read.    While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the     octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence     of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote     exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing     modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`,     `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to     directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module     `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present     on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be     specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important     modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability. (CVE-2022-24903)Note that Nessus has not tested for this issue but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.
      Solution
      Update the affected packages.

      Nessus Plugin ID 162762 with High Severity
      Synopsis
      The remote Debian host is missing one or more security-related updates.
      Description
      The remote Debian 11 host has packages installed that are affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the dsa-5177 advisory.  - LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is an open source web frontend for managing entries stored in an LDAP     directory. The profile editor tool has an edit profile functionality, the parameters on this page are not     properly sanitized and hence leads to stored XSS attacks. An authenticated user can store XSS payloads in     the profiles, which gets triggered when any other user try to access the edit profile page. The pdf editor     tool has an edit pdf profile functionality, the logoFile parameter in it is not properly sanitized and an     user can enter relative paths like     ../../../../../../../../../../../../../usr/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps/gvim.png via tools like     burpsuite. Later when a pdf is exported using the edited profile the pdf icon has the image on that     path(if image is present). Both issues require an attacker to be able to login to LAM admin interface. The     issue is fixed in version 7.9.1. (CVE-2022-24851)  - LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g. users, groups, DHCP settings)     stored in an LDAP directory. In versions prior to 8.0 There are cases where LAM instantiates objects from     arbitrary classes. An attacker can inject the first constructor argument. This can lead to code execution     if non-LAM classes are instantiated that execute code during object creation. This issue has been fixed in     version 8.0. (CVE-2022-31084)  - LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g. users, groups, DHCP settings)     stored in an LDAP directory. In versions prior to 8.0 the session files include the LDAP user name and     password in clear text if the PHP OpenSSL extension is not installed or encryption is disabled by     configuration. This issue has been fixed in version 8.0. Users unable to upgrade should install the PHP     OpenSSL extension and make sure session encryption is enabled in LAM main configuration. (CVE-2022-31085)  - LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g. users, groups, DHCP settings)     stored in an LDAP directory. In versions prior to 8.0 incorrect regular expressions allow to upload PHP     scripts to config/templates/pdf. This vulnerability could lead to a Remote Code Execution if the     /config/templates/pdf/ directory is accessible for remote users. This is not a default configuration of     LAM. This issue has been fixed in version 8.0. There are no known workarounds for this issue.    (CVE-2022-31086)  - LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g. users, groups, DHCP settings)     stored in an LDAP directory. In versions prior to 8.0 the tmp directory, which is accessible by /lam/tmp/,     allows interpretation of .php (and .php5/.php4/.phpt/etc) files. An attacker capable of writing files     under www-data privileges can write a web-shell into this directory, and gain a Code Execution on the     host. This issue has been fixed in version 8.0. Users unable to upgrade should disallow executing PHP     scripts in (/var/lib/ldap-account-manager/)tmp directory. (CVE-2022-31087)  - LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g. users, groups, DHCP settings)     stored in an LDAP directory. In versions prior to 8.0 the user name field at login could be used to     enumerate LDAP data. This is only the case for LDAP search configuration. This issue has been fixed in     version 8.0. (CVE-2022-31088)Note that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.
      Solution
      Upgrade the ldap-account-manager packages.For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in version 8.0.1-0+deb11u1.

      Nessus Plugin ID 162730 with High Severity
      Synopsis
      The remote FreeBSD host is missing one or more security-related updates.
      Description
      The version of FreeBSD installed on the remote host is prior to tested version. It is, therefore, affected by a vulnerability as referenced in the a28e8b7e-fc70-11ec-856e-d4c9ef517024 advisory.  - AES OCB mode for 32-bit x86 platforms using the AES-NI assembly optimised implementation will not encrypt     the entirety of the data under some circumstances. This could reveal sixteen bytes of data that was     preexisting in the memory that wasn't written. In the special case of in place encryption, sixteen bytes     of the plaintext would be revealed. Since OpenSSL does not support OCB based cipher suites for TLS and     DTLS, they are both unaffected. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.5 (Affected 3.0.0-3.0.4). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1q     (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1p). (CVE-2022-2097)Note that Nessus has not tested for this issue but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.

(CVE-2022-27776)  - Guzzle is a PHP HTTP client. Guzzle prior to versions 6.5.6 and 7.4.3 contains a vulnerability with the     cookie middleware. The vulnerability is that it is not checked if the cookie domain equals the domain of     the server which sets the cookie via the Set-Cookie header, allowing a malicious server to set cookies for     unrelated domains. The cookie middleware is disabled by default, so most library consumers will not be     affected by this issue.

This flaw allows a local user to gain unauthorized access to data from the FUSE filesystem, resulting in     privilege escalation. (CVE-2022-1011)  - A vulnerability was found in the pfkey_register function in net/key/af_key.c in the Linux kernel. This     flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to gain access to kernel memory, leading to a system crash or a     leak of internal kernel information. (CVE-2022-1353)  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel's X.25 set of standardized network protocols     functionality in the way a user terminates their session using a simulated Ethernet card and continued     usage of this connection. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system. (CVE-2022-1516)  - A flaw in Linux Kernel found in nfcmrvl_nci_unregister_dev() in drivers/nfc/nfcmrvl/main.c can lead to use     after free both read or write when non synchronized between cleanup routine and firmware download routine.    (CVE-2022-1734)  - Incomplete cleanup of multi-core shared buffers for some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authenticated     user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.

(CVE-2022-21166)  - Linux PV device frontends vulnerable to attacks by backends T[his CNA information record relates to     multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Several Linux PV     device frontends are using the grant table interfaces for removing access rights of the backends in ways     being subject to race conditions, resulting in potential data leaks, data corruption by malicious     backends, and denial of service triggered by malicious backends: blkfront, netfront, scsifront and the     gntalloc driver are testing whether a grant reference is still in use. If this is not the case, they     assume that a following removal of the granted access will always succeed, which is not true in case the     backend has mapped the granted page between those two operations. As a result the backend can keep access     to the memory page of the guest no matter how the page will be used after the frontend I/O has finished.    The xenbus driver has a similar problem, as it doesn't check the success of removing the granted access of     a shared ring buffer. blkfront: CVE-2022-23036 netfront: CVE-2022-23037 scsifront: CVE-2022-23038     gntalloc: CVE-2022-23039 xenbus: CVE-2022-23040 blkfront, netfront, scsifront, usbfront, dmabuf, xenbus,     9p, kbdfront, and pvcalls are using a functionality to delay freeing a grant reference until it is no     longer in use, but the freeing of the related data page is not synchronized with dropping the granted     access. As a result the backend can keep access to the memory page even after it has been freed and then     re-used for a different purpose. CVE-2022-23041 netfront will fail a BUG_ON() assertion if it fails to     revoke access in the rx path. This will result in a Denial of Service (DoS) situation of the guest which     can be triggered by the backend. CVE-2022-23042 (CVE-2022-23036, CVE-2022-23037, CVE-2022-23038,     CVE-2022-23039, CVE-2022-23040, CVE-2022-23041, CVE-2022-23042)  - Certain Arm Cortex and Neoverse processors through 2022-03-08 do not properly restrict cache speculation,     aka Spectre-BHB. An attacker can leverage the shared branch history in the Branch History Buffer (BHB) to     influence mispredicted branches. Then, cache allocation can allow the attacker to obtain sensitive     information. (CVE-2022-23960)  - drivers/usb/gadget/legacy/inode.c in the Linux kernel through 5.16.8 mishandles dev->buf release.    (CVE-2022-24958)  - st21nfca_connectivity_event_received in drivers/nfc/st21nfca/se.c in the Linux kernel through 5.16.12 has     EVT_TRANSACTION buffer overflows because of untrusted length parameters. (CVE-2022-26490)  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.12. drivers/net/usb/sr9700.c allows attackers to     obtain sensitive information from heap memory via crafted frame lengths from a device. (CVE-2022-26966)  - In drivers/usb/gadget/udc/udc-xilinx.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.12, the endpoint index is not     validated and might be manipulated by the host for out-of-array access. (CVE-2022-27223)  - In the Linux kernel before 5.17.1, a refcount leak bug was found in net/llc/af_llc.c. (CVE-2022-28356)  - ems_usb_start_xmit in drivers/net/can/usb/ems_usb.c in the Linux kernel through 5.17.1 has a double free.    (CVE-2022-28390)  - The Linux kernel before 5.17.2 mishandles seccomp permissions. The PTRACE_SEIZE code path allows attackers     to bypass intended restrictions on setting the PT_SUSPEND_SECCOMP flag. (CVE-2022-30594)  - net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c in the Linux kernel through 5.18.1 allows a local user (able to create     user/net namespaces) to escalate privileges to root because an incorrect NFT_STATEFUL_EXPR check leads to     a use-after-free. (CVE-2022-32250)  - The Linux kernel before 5.17.9 allows TCP servers to identify clients by observing what source ports are     used. (CVE-2022-32296)  - drivers/block/floppy.c in the Linux kernel before 5.17.6 is vulnerable to a denial of service, because of     a concurrency use-after-free flaw after deallocating raw_cmd in the raw_cmd_ioctl function.    (CVE-2022-33981)Note that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.

      Synopsis
      The remote Oracle Linux host is missing a security update.
      Description
      The remote Oracle Linux 8 host has a package installed that is affected by a vulnerability as referenced in the ELSA-2022-5326 advisory.  - The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop     forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain     elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point     encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has     invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the     certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a     denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they     can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients     consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking     certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from     subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that     use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS     issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate     which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the     public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-     signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue     affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the     15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected     1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc). (CVE-2022-0778)Note that Nessus has not tested for this issue but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.
      Solution
      Update the affected compat-openssl10 package.

      Description
      The remote Debian 9 host has a package installed that is affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the dla-3066 advisory.  - A flaw was found in mbsync before v1.3.5 and v1.4.1. Validations of the mailbox names returned by IMAP     LIST/LSUB do not occur allowing a malicious or compromised server to use specially crafted mailbox names     containing '..' path components to access data outside the designated mailbox on the opposite end of the     synchronization channel. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and     integrity. (CVE-2021-20247)  - A flaw was found in mbsync before v1.3.6 and v1.4.2, where an unchecked pointer cast allows a malicious or     compromised server to write an arbitrary integer value past the end of a heap-allocated structure by     issuing an unexpected APPENDUID response. This could be plausibly exploited for remote code execution on     the client. (CVE-2021-3578)  - A flaw was found in mbsync versions prior to 1.4.4. Due to inadequate handling of extremely large (>=2GiB)     IMAP literals, malicious or compromised IMAP servers, and hypothetically even external email senders,     could cause several different buffer overflows, which could conceivably be exploited for remote code     execution.

When     displaying an email that contains a digital signature, the email's date will be shown. If the dates were     different, then Thunderbird didn't report the email as having an invalid signature.

(CVE-2022-34470)  - An iframe that was not permitted to run scripts could do so if the user clicked on a     javascript: link. (CVE-2022-34468)  - An OpenPGP digital signature includes information about the date when the signature was created. When     displaying an email that contains a digital signature, the email's date will be shown. If the dates were     different, then Thunderbird didn't report the email as having an invalid signature. If an attacker     performed a replay attack, in which an old email with old contents are resent at a later time, it could     lead the victim to believe that the statements in the email are current. Fixed versions of Thunderbird     will require that the signature's date roughly matches the displayed date of the email. (CVE-2022-2226)  - In the nsTArrayImpl::ReplaceElementsAt() function, an integer overflow could have occurred     when the number of elements to replace was too large for the container. (CVE-2022-34481)  - An attacker could have injected CSS into stylesheets accessible via internal URIs, such as resource:, and     in doing so bypass a page's Content Security Policy. (CVE-2022-31744)  - If there was a PAC URL set and the server that hosts the PAC was not reachable, OCSP requests would have     been blocked, resulting in incorrect error pages being shown. (CVE-2022-34472)  - The ms-msdt, search, and search-ms protocols deliver content to     Microsoft applications, bypassing the browser, when a user accepts a prompt. These applications have had     known vulnerabilities, exploited in the wild (although we know of none exploited through Thunderbird), so     in this release Thunderbird has blocked these protocols from prompting the user to open them. This bug     only affects Thunderbird on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2022-34478)  - If an object prototype was corrupted by an attacker, they would have been able to set undesired attributes     on a JavaScript object, leading to privileged code execution. (CVE-2022-2200)  - The Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported potential vulnerabilities present in Thunderbird 91.10. Some of these     bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have     been exploited to run arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-34484)Note that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.
      Solution
      Upgrade to Mozilla Thunderbird version 91.11 or later.

      Description
      According to its self-reported version, the Tenable SecurityCenter application installed on the remote host is running 5.19.x, 5.20.x, or 5.21.0 and is therefore affected by multiple vulnerabilities:        - The ap_rwrite() function in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may read unintended memory if an       attacker can cause the server to reflect very large input using ap_rwrite() or ap_rputs(), such as       with mod_luas r:puts() function. Modules compiled and distributed separately from Apache HTTP Server       that use the 'ap_rputs' function and may pass it a very large (INT_MAX or larger) string must be       compiled against current headers to resolve the issue. (CVE-2022-28614)         - Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may crash or disclose information due to a read beyond bounds       in ap_strcmp_match() when provided with an extremely large input buffer. While no code distributed       with the server can be coerced into such a call, third-party modules or lua scripts that use       ap_strcmp_match() may hypothetically be affected. (CVE-2022-28615)    - Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may not send the X-Forwarded-* headers to the origin server       based on client side Connection header hop-by-hop mechanism. This may be used to bypass IP based       authentication on the origin server/application.

      Nessus Plugin ID 162611 with High Severity
      Synopsis
      The remote Debian host is missing a security-related update.
      Description
      The remote Debian 9 host has packages installed that are affected by a vulnerability as referenced in the dla-3061 advisory.  - A Privilege Context Switching issue was discovered in join.c in Firejail 0.9.68. By crafting a bogus     Firejail container that is accepted by the Firejail setuid-root program as a join target, a local attacker     can enter an environment in which the Linux user namespace is still the initial user namespace, the     NO_NEW_PRIVS prctl is not activated, and the entered mount namespace is under the attacker's control. In     this way, the filesystem layout can be adjusted to gain root privileges through execution of available     setuid-root binaries such as su or sudo. (CVE-2022-31214)Note that Nessus has not tested for this issue but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.
      Solution
      Upgrade the firejail packages.For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version 0.9.58.2-2+deb9u1.
